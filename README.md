# chook_raffle
Chook_Raffle draws a random number using large font for display on a TV.
With a press of the spacebar, chook_raffle will generate a random number between a Min and Max and present it using pygame in a nicely rendered font.
If using the split screen, the operator will be able to see the number before anyone else does.
