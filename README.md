# chook_raffle
Chook_Raffle draws a random number using large font for display on a TV.
With a press of the spacebar, chook_raffle will generate a random number between a Min and Max and present it using pygame in a nicely rendered font.

A log is written to the Terminal which updates the user on progress and gives the winning number while the display slowly stops on the winning number - giving the camera producer plenty of time to find the winner for reaction shots.
